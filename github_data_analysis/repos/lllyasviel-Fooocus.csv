prevent users from skipping/stopping other users tasks in queue,981,"fixes inconsistency in behaviour of stop_button and skip_button as it was possible to skip or stop other users processes while still being in queue.

Expected:
sessions are completely separate, no interference or control by other users except yourself

Actual:
one can skip and stop tasks of others

Steps to reproduce:
1. open 2 tabs
2. click ""generate"" in tab 1
3. click ""generate"" in tab 2
4. see skip/stop button in tab 2
5. click skip/stop button in tab 2, task for tab1 skips/stops

**this is also possible using x tabs, where the last tab clicking ""generate"" can skip all previous queued tasks**

Upgrade version of Gradio to 4.3.0,961,"Hi, I have a try to upgrade the Gradio framework to V4.3 which it brings better scalability and security to Fooocus. Meanwhile, Gradio V4 support custom components so that the hack component could be more maintainable.

Because the Image component has been refactored and is totally different to the V3.X one. I developed a custom component named [LegacyImage](https://github.com/herve-ves/gradio-legacyimage) to make the releated functionality compatible with Gradio V4.3.

I am testing and evaluating this commit, it works fine with UOV, CN and inpaint. I hope my work could help to Fooocus.",open,2023-11-16T02:46:21Z,,herve-ves,1,63,545,7

Add option for default performance setting + suffix ordinals with lambda,845,"- Adds the ability to set a default performance setting in user_path_config rather than always defaulting to 'Speed'
- When doing multiple generations: Rather than always suffixing the number with ""-th"" (e.g., 1-th, 2-th...), now uses a lambda to determine the correct suffix to apply to the number (e.g., 1-st, 2-nd, 3-rd...)
