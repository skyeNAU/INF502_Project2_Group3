Closes #10506 

It aims to complete the following tasks mentioned in the issue :

1. Add a warning icon in the field which contains non-ascii characters.  (The non-ascii check should be only in bibtex mode, not in biblatex mode). For example:

![image](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/assets/64955334/6bcf53d8-595c-43a6-a85a-c0de209e1dc3)

2. Let JabRef focus on the corresponding tab where the problem occurs in the entry editor, after clicking the item in the Check Integrity table.

### Discussion

- Task 1

I changed the class ASCIICharacterChecker from implementing `EntryChecker` to `ValueChecker`.  

Because adding a warning icon relys on the function `viewModel.getFieldValidator().getValidationStatus()`. 
And there are many classes for `viewModel` such as SimpleEditorViewModel, JournalEditorViewModel, PersonsEditorViewModel, which are separately related to the fields Abstract, Journal, Title, Author, etc.. 
I hope to check all fields together, so I found the superclass for viewModles `AbstractEditorViewModel`. It uses the class `FieldCheckers` to store various field checker. 
However, in the function `fieldCheckers.put(field, checker)`, checker should be of class `ValueChecker`.

It's easy to adopt `ValueChecker` to `EntryChecher` by using the class `FieldChecker`, whereas it's difficult.
I also tried to use the class `IntegrityCheck`, but `AbstractEditorViewModel` just accept `FieldCheckers` as parameter. It's also complex to add `IntegrityCheck` as parameter in `FieldEditors` when initializing viewModles.

I'd be grateful if you have a better solution to tell me.

A relevance field was modified so it can  no longer be visible upon hovering as it was causing confusion regarding the actual value of selected entry. It has been modified so a new menu appears upon clicking on the ""Relevance"" field of a selected entry with a selection of 2 options to set it to - Set as Relevant / Set as Irrelevant. Upon choosing one of the mentioned options, the selected entry will be then marked / unmarked with the star icon based by the chosen option. Adding a menu option for ""Relevance"" was to maintain visual consistency with the existing menu options for special fields such as ""Read"" and ""Priority."" Basic tests were also created for this.

I am not sure about the label ""Add"". Maybe ""Add JabRef-featured user-specific comment""? Exact, but too long.

Alternatives considered:

- Global preference to show the user-specific field --> too hidden for me - users won't find it
- Library-specific setting to enable --> requires pro-users to setup the .bib file accordingly (and much more coding effort)

update:

1. When user delete entries, files which linked to selected entries are also delete
2. When user cut entries, keep files unchanged 
3. Solved the access error caused by repeated deletion of files when one file is attached to multiple entries
4. A pop-up dialog box to confirm whether the user wants to delete attached files from selected entry, and the name of the file to be deleted will be displayed

5. Keep track of user preference: if the user prefers always delete attached files, then delete the files without displaying the dialog box.

Fixes https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/549

I'll start explaining the changes I've made from the top of the method chain.
1. `ImportHandler`
It is the place where the logic of importing a PDF file starts being executed.
At line 119, there's an `importPDFContent` (of `ExternalFilesContentImporter` class) method executed, which takes in a filepath as a parameter. In order to access the ""General file directory"" library property, I've modified this method (see 2nd point).
2. `ExternalFilesContentImporter`
As mentioned, `importPDFContent` method gets a new parameter: an instance of `MetaData`. The ""General file directory"" path is stored there.
3. `PdfMergeMetadataImporter`
Finally, the actual logic is being executed here. The class is an implementation of an abstract class `Importer`. Among others, it overrides `importDatabase(Path)` method. Previous step's method `importPDFContent` calls `PdfMergeMetadataImporter`'s `importDatabase` method, where the filepath can be manipulated. Because of extending that method, I can provide `importDatabase` with `MetaData` object. At last - just at the end of the method - I've included some basic logic that:
* checks whether the ""General file directory"" is present
* if it is, the filepath is relativized (`C
* if it is not, the absolute path is displayed

Please, do provide me with feedback on the above implementation. I'm particularly interested whether the extensions with `MetaData` instance is an okay decision. I'm also wondering if the ""General file directory"" property may be accessed in some other way.

Note that I've not included any changes to the `CHANGELOG.md` as this is still a work-in-progress pull request and it does not yet solve the issue of other than PDF files.

Command line now supports option ""jumpToEntryKey"" or ""-j"" folowed by one entrykey argument.
Upon start up, jabref will search the imported files (BibTex files given as command line arguments) for the entrykey and focus this library and select this entry. Recently opened files will not be searched for this key, as it may be out of the scope of my knowledge of the repository to handle this gracefully. 

As mentioned by @calixtus refactoring is likely necessary to create a better way to mix the cli commands into the UI. Though functionality works as expected. 

If this change is merged user documentation at https://docs.jabref.org/advanced/commandline may need to add this feature.

Assign colour with maximal HSV distance when create a new group. Greatest distance is used for top level groups. I have also implemented method for sub level groups using single hue scale, but I am having trouble distinguishing between top level groups and sub level groups while creating a new group now. So, the colour of the sub group in the screenshot does not use the same hue scale as their top level group.

Fixes #7613 

This is my first pr, I appreciate feedback from all aspects. If there's anything I did wrong please correct me.

Lucene search backend,8963,"First draft of the switch to the Lucene Search Backend

## Whats working

- Added all bib-fields to the index
- BibEntry hash is used as an identifier in the index
- Both fulltext and bib-fields are indexed together, in the same index, in the background. BibEntry-fields changes are prioritized as they are very quick.
- Can see in the code that searches in bib-fields are working as expected
- Switch current search to use the lucene backend
- Sort search-results by lucene score. This means search will not filter the table anymore, but merely sort according to results
- Global  search (in contrast to main table, the global search window filters for matches with score > 0)
- Change the file button-icon depending on whether there was a fulltext-search match for this entry
- Search-Groups
- Floating search
- Switch to force sort by score or not

## Todo

- [ ] Remove old search
- [x] Display x.y at score only (two decimal places)
  - [ ] The cell itself should be colored. From green to red (all in light shade): 10=green, 0= red
- [x] Decide whether to display score column. Currently, it shows when a search is active. Users probably cannot do anything with the values, though. Maybe use it to shade entries with high relevance?
   - --> We keep the score column
- [x] Use gray background for score==0. See https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4237#issuecomment-993325334.
  - [ ]  Scroll to top until hits are shown (scroll down 1 shows a gray line)

## Follow-ups

- Improve fulltext-search-results display
  - A little improvement was already done. The file icon in the table is now different (shows a magnifying glass) when there were search results in a linked file.
  - Could be improved even more by inserting a fulltext-results row below the actual row.
- Improve query-entry (like #8356?)

## Problems:

- [x] The score-column is always used to sort the table as highest-priority. JabRef will only sort by two columns max. This means with the search-score being one of them, users can only sort by one column.
  - Solution: add sort-columns with shift-click
  - Solution: Sorting by score column is not forced but optional
- [x] Everything is indexed with the JabRef field names, which are in English. This means, either we translate the fields when creating an index, or people need to use the english terms for search queries. Translating the fields in english would mean a re-index needs to be triggered whenever the language changes and JabRef would need to notice if the language changed while it was closed.
  - Solution: leave as-is, search-syntax is English and was English before the migration to lucene
- [ ] Search group migration.
  - Lucene syntax is different for normal searches (: instead of = to search in a field)
  - Regex should still work
  - No more pseudo-fields
  - [ ] maybe implement #9072 first, to ease the transition
  - Should users deal with this themselves?

Fixes #8857

Fixes #5484 by enabling ""Jump to entry"" for,

* `CROSSREF`
* `XREF`
* `ENTRYSET`
* `IDS`
* `RELATED`
* `XDATA`

in the Entry Editor.

I have only verified it for `CROSSREF` since I don't know how the others are supposed to work. But, since this is re-enabling a feature disabled in #2840 I expect that it is how things used to be.

@tobiasdiez there is a risk this is doing almost exactly what you didn't want in #2840 (directly use the `JabRefFrame` class).

The following things have been added:

- The branch refine-search from #8206 has been added in order to have lucene syntax support.
- Added popover for the GlobalSearchBar to simplify the lucene search called DropdownMenu
- Added recent search list into the popover
- Added visual feedback for Search Query validity. (GlobalSearchBar is green for a valid Query and red for invalid query).
- Pressing buttons in the DropDownMenu adds a new SearchItem to the searchItemList in SearchFieldSynchronizer and
synchronizes with the GlobalSearchBar.
- Added intern textfield in DropDownMenu in order to autocomplete the typed searchstrings. With an add, search and delete button you are able to add the typed string to the GlobalSearchBar, with the search-button you can search your global repository and with the delete button you can delete the whole searchstring .
- Removed RegexButton.
